# Logistic-Map
a logistic map generator

This is the first encounter for me with python, and programming in the first place..
For some time I got fascinated with the logistic map function and how it is mapped...
I don't know much about the complexities behind it, and I just started take an interist in a making a cod eto calculate it.
Any was this program grew to make use of a cpu multicores and then added a simple gui..
Its a working progress however I'm proud of how I came so far from nothing.
Any feedback will be much appreciated...
Thanks
